# jupyter-exploration
1/25/24 I explored GitHub's interface.  In the exploration, I clicked on repositories, issues, and pull requests.  Each tab automatically sent me to a page with 3 tabs, "created, assigned, and mentioned".  These tabs are all blank at this time.  I then clicked on the "search all Github" button and again the page was blank until I search for something specific.  It does not give any suggestions.  Per the class instructions, I created a new repository and name it "jupyter-exploration" with a "README" commit.
